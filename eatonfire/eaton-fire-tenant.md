To capture the information here: my renter friend contacted a pro bono lawyer and was advised to request 1) a prorated rent refund for the period of loss of use and 2) financial relocation assistance from the landlord's commercial policy, which requires the claim and policy ID from the landlord. Both of these requests fall under legal tenant rights and protections.
